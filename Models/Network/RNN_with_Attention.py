def attention(inputs, attention_size, time_major=False, return_alphas=False):
    """

    Attention mechanism layer which reduces RNN/Bi-RNN outputs with Attention vector.
    The idea was proposed in the article by Z. Yang et al., "Hierarchical Attention Networks
     for Document Classification", 2016: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1174.
    Variables notation is also inherited from the article

    Args:
        inputs: The Attention inputs.
            Matches outputs of RNN/Bi-RNN layer (not final state):
                In case of RNN, this must be RNN outputs `Tensor`:
                    If time_major == False (default), this must be a tensor of shape:
                        `[batch_size, max_time, cell.output_size]`.
                    If time_major == True, this must be a tensor of shape:
                        `[max_time, batch_size, cell.output_size]`.
                In case of Bidirectional RNN, this must be a tuple (outputs_fw, outputs_bw) containing the forward and
                the backward RNN outputs `Tensor`.
                    If time_major == False (default),
                        outputs_fw is a `Tensor` shaped:
                        `[batch_size, max_time, cell_fw.output_size]`
                        and outputs_bw is a `Tensor` shaped:
                        `[batch_size, max_time, cell_bw.output_size]`.
                    If time_major == True,
                        outputs_fw is a `Tensor` shaped:
                        `[max_time, batch_size, cell_fw.output_size]`
                        and outputs_bw is a `Tensor` shaped:
                        `[max_time, batch_size, cell_bw.output_size]`.
        attention_size: Linear size of the Attention weights.
        time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` Tensors.
            If true, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`.
            If false, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`.
            Using `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids
            transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However,
            most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function
            accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.
        return_alphas: Whether to return attention coefficients variable along with layer's output.
            Used for visualization purpose.

    Returns:
        The Attention output `Tensor`.
        In case of RNN, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
            `[batch_size, cell.output_size]`.
        In case of Bidirectional RNN, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
            `[batch_size, cell_fw.output_size + cell_bw.output_size]`.
